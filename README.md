# xmasic2_climate_summary
Pulls climate information from the [xmacis website](https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/) for specific locations to create a monthly summary.

Copy google sheet template with script and make it your own. You will need to adjust the script to match your sheet. 
[Link to Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zeZTXVL51DVJ-CJ52h4oB06VnXa63g6jLKyED2XapCE/edit?usp=sharing)

DO NOT 
Download sheet and REUPLOAD it as an excel sheet. This will eliminate the script!!!
Change any sheet names or the layout/design!!!


STEPS:

Open NEW YYYY Climate data spreadsheet (located: Google J - drive under “Climate Data Worksheets” )
Must be the only email logged in or run from incognito mode (ctrl + shift + n). Does not seem to be the case anymore, you should be able to just run it.

Go to the sheet you want to update or create that sheet. If the monthly sheet has not been created, make a copy of sheet “YYYY-MM” and fill in your Year and Month using YYYY and MM format. For annual, copy YYYY-MM, and use just the year i.e. 2022.

Click “Run Script -> Update Climate” located next to “Help”
“Running Script” in green will appear. Wait until is disappears to look at the data
Cell formatting will adjust colors to make them pop more
Petersburg data is not coming into xmacis correctly at the moment (10/22/2021). Use the wxCoder information.
M - missing is used for months with over 3 days of missing data.
During the cold season, manually look-up Hoonah’s monthly snow accumulation data on xmacis, & fill it in on the table on the lower-left of the spreadsheet.

If you want records too, hit  “Update Records”
“Running Script” in green will appear. Wait until it disappears to look at the data. This will take about 15 seconds. 
Annette is META2 and only has about a decade of data. If you need this record, you can find it on xmacis.
Klawock started in 1998, so ranking will be overly impressive
If there are multiple years with the same value, your record may pull in a different order than xmacis would, but the value should not be that far off.


Plots
Can be found under MMM 2021 Precip & MMM 2021 Avg Temp sheets.  Make copies of the previous month’s MMMYYYY Avg Temp, MMMYYYY Precip, & MMMYYYY Snow sheets, & rename them to the current month & year of interest.
Click on the “Edit chart” tab.
Click :”Setup” tab on the column window that opens to the right.
3 down, click “data range”...
Ex.) Change sheet name in the range from ‘2022-09’ to ‘2022-10’ to change the info from sept 2022 to oct 2022 sheet.
Then, update the month to the month of interest in the chart’s title via the “Customize” tab to the right.
Try not to adjust the format, as it is linked to the PPT slide, and they may distort the text. I recommend having the slide open at the same time to check how your changes impact the image
If you mess up, create another duplicate. from the “DO NOT TOUCH” version of the sheet.
Take a screenshot of the plots using the “Snipping Tool”, paste those into the traditional monthly climate summary PPT for use on social media & the WxStory, & edit the narrative portion & other details as normal…  **NOTE**: Do not use the “Download Chart” button, because, currently, the image that it creates will cut off cities, data, & create disproportionally large and overlapping font on top of the bars in the chart.  Don’t use the auto-populated PPT in “Step 6”, below for the same reason…

PPT
Can be found here
Update text accordingly
To update the plot, click on it, and the click “Update” button that appears in upper right corner of image every time you make change to the excel sheet version

*All data is based on no more than 3 days of missing data.
